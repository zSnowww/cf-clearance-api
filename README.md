# CF-Clearance-Scraper

## Zendriver Version
A simple program for scraping Cloudflare clearance (cf_clearance) cookies from websites issuing Cloudflare challenges to visitors. This program works on all Cloudflare challenge types (JavaScript, managed, and interactive). If you would prefer using Playwright, you can check out the [Playwright version](https://github.com/Xewdy444/CF-Clearance-Scraper/tree/playwright).


## Clearance Cookie Usage
In order to bypass Cloudflare challenges with the clearance cookies, you must make sure of two things:

- The user agent used to fetch the clearance cookie must match the user agent being used within the requests that use the clearance cookie
> [!NOTE]
> The default user agent used by the scraper is `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`.
- The IP address used to fetch the clearance cookie must match the IP address being used to make the requests that use the clearance cookie

```

## Installation
Download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html).

Then, install the Python dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> Depending on the user agent used, it may affect your ability to solve the Cloudflare challenge.
